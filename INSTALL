*** csl installation ***

To compile the csl library and all command line tools, you need the build
program 'cmake', which is part of virtually any linux distribution.

Unpack the source tarball and change into its root directory. Then type:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

This shold build the library in ./lib and all executables in ./bin .

You can also try 'make install', but I don't guarantee I haven't forgotten
to specify one or the other binary to be installed. It does install the
library to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib and the more important programs to
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/bin . CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX defaults to "/usr/local/", but
you can use 'ccmake' to change the prefix.
Just do

cmake ..
ccmake .  # if you want to change paths: just follow the help given in the program.
make
make install
